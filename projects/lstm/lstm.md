# LSTM

This is our project. I started by working on an LSTM to predict crypto prices (time-series forecasting). I then realized we could likely provide the rails to onboard, evaluate, and use 3rd party models on-chain, rather than building and training our own. This will allow us to deploy a "larger" project on Ritual without having the ceiling of our model's performance.
